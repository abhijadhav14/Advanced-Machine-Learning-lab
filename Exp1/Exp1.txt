1. Implementation of Naive Bayes.

AIM:
The aim is to build a text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
This model will classify emails as "Spam" or "Not Spam" based on their content.

Algorithm:
• Data Preprocessing
• Read the CSV file.
• Convert text data into numerical feature vectors using techniques like Bag
of Words or TF-IDF.

Calculate Prior Probabilities:
• Compute the prior probability of each class (Spam or Not Spam).

Calculate Likelihoods:
• Compute the likelihood of each feature (word) given each class.

Apply Bayes' Theorem:
• Calculate the posterior probability for each class given a new email
Classification
• Assign the class with the highest posterior probability to the new email.
Implementation in Python
We'll use the scikit-learn library for our implementation, which simplifies
the process.
